## Microsoft Program Management Professional Certificate (7 course series)


Prepare for a new career in this high-demand field with professional training from Microsoft.

Program managers are skilled and organized professionals who oversee multiple related projects within an organization to ensure they work together effectively. They ensure all the projects align with the company’s goals, stay on track, and deliver the expected benefits. They coordinate between teams, manage resources, and handle any issues that arise, making sure the overall program is successful and objectives are met.

You'll develop a strong foundation in program management through a mix of videos, readings, assessments, and hands-on activities.

If you pursue associated certifications such as the PgMP (Program Management Professional) from PMI, or the MSP (Managing Successful Programs) Practitioner from AXELOS, you can be confident in your preparation by practicing with sample questions and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the exam structure, content, and requirements. You will have the opportunity to apply your acquired knowledge and skills in practical scenarios through case studies and interactive exercises, reinforcing learning and improving your program management capabilities.

When you graduate, you’ll have tangible examples to discuss in job interviews or share with your network.
